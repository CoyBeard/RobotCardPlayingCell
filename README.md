 Industrial Robots Play UNO

Thank you for taking an interest in my project! And remember, a YouTube video is available
on my YouTube channel: "Coy Beardmore" that explains the whole project.

Here you can find enough documentation to recreate the project:

- CAD: All the 3D files used for the project, including the gripper controller. I use SolidEdge 2024 Community Edition so all the files are in .par but the .stp is available for other platforms. 

- Code: all the programming for the project including the PC program with the interface
and the code for the gripper controllers

- ML Data Set: I only included the raw data due to the files large size. 
use this if you want but I strongly recommend that you create your own 
data set for your environment.
